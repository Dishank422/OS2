To test the program, place the files Assgn3-Src-<name>-AI20BTECH11011.cpp and inp-params.txt in the same directory. <name> corresponds to tas, cas or cas-bounded.

The first number in inp-params.txt is the number of threads.
The second number is k, the number of time each thread enters critical section.
The other two numbers are lambda1 and lambda2 respectively.

To run the program, go to that directory in terminal and execute the command "g++ Assgn3-Src-<name>-AI20BTECH11011.cpp && ./a.out" in the terminal.

output.txt file will be generated as per requirements and the results can be seen there.
