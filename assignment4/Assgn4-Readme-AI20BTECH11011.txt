To test the program, place the files Assgn4-Src-AI20BTECH11011.cpp and inp-params.txt in the same directory.
The first number in inp-params.txt is the number of passengers and the second number is the number of cars.
The 3rd and 4th numbers are lambda_p and lambda_c respectively. The last number is the value of K.

To run the program, go to that directory in terminal and execute the command "g++ Assgn4-Src-AI20BTECH11011.cpp && ./a.out" in the terminal.

output.txt file will be generated as per requirements and the results can be seen there.
