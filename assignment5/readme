Uncompress the tar file and go to the xv6 folder

To run the xv6 OS, execute
$ make qemu-nox

To clean the folder, execute
$ make clean

For part A, you need to uncomment two things in the "syscall.c" file. 
This is written this way in order to keep the outputs of parts B and C human readable.

For part B, execute
$ mydate
in the xv6 terminal

For part C, execute
$ mypgtPrint 
in the xv6 terminal

For part C, in order to see the results of local and global arrays, go to mypgtPrint.c and make the appropriate changes.
Instructions for this are provided in the file itself.
