To test the program, place the files Assgn1_Src_AI20BTECH11011.cpp and inp.txt in the same directory.
The first number in inp.txt is the number of points and the second number is the number of threads to use.
To run the program, go to that directory in terminal and execute the command "g++ Assgn1_Src_AI20BTECH11011.cpp && ./a.out" in the terminal.

output.txt file will be generated as per requirements and the results can be seen there.
