To test the program, place the files Assgn2SrcOpenMP-AI20BTECH11011.cpp, Assgn2Srcpthreads-AI20BTECH11011.cpp and input.txt in the same directory.
The first number in input.txt is the dimension of the sudoku and the second number is the number of threads to use.
Line2 onwards, the sudoku is given in the input.txt file.

To run the programs, go to that directory in terminal and execute the following command for OpenMP
$ "g++ Assgn2SrcOpenMP-AI20BTECH11011.cpp -fopenmp && ./a.out"

and the following command for Pthreads
$ "g++ Assgn2Srcpthread-AI20BTECH11011.cpp && ./a.out"

output.txt file will be generated as per requirements and the results can be seen there.
